Medifi Medtech Solutions (USA) Limited ("Medifi") respects Your privacy and is committed to protecting it through its compliance with this Privacy Policy.

Medifi provides this Privacy Policy to inform You (“You”), the end user of the www.Medifi.com website  (“Site”), the Medifi mobile application (“Application”), the software underlying the Site and Application (“Software”), and any Materials or Documents (as such terms are defined below) issued in connection with the Site, Application and/or Software, whether as a guest or a registered user, of its practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) that Medifi receives from users of Site and/or Application.  Any Site, Application, Software, Materials, Documents or services provided to You in conjunction with the Site or Application will be referred to together as the “Services.”  “Materials” mean the Site, Application, Software and their entire contents, features and functionality, including, without limitation, all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof.  “Documents” or “Documentation” include the Medifi Business Associate Agreement and any other proprietary documents provided to You by Medifi now or hereafter.
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that You provide when You use the Services and that Medifi and business partners of Medifi collect through the Services.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected offline or on any other websites or applications that You may access through the Services or information provided to and collected by any third party.  Third parties may have their own privacy policies, which Medifi encourages You to read before providing information to, on or through them.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand Medifi policies and practices regarding Personal Information.  If You do not agree with the Medifi policies and practices, do not download, register, use or otherwise interact with the Services.
By downloading, registering with or using the Services, You consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
This policy is subject to change from time to time in the sole discretion of Medifi.  Your continued use of the Services after Medifi makes a change to the Privacy Policy is deemed to be acceptance of such change.  Thus, please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
### 1. Information Collection: The Personally Identifiable Information that Medifi Collects
In the course of using the Services, You may provide Medifi with Your personally identifiable information. "Personally identifiable information" refers to information about You that can be used to contact or identify You and information related to Your use of the Services that may be connected with You and identify You (collectively, “Personal Information”). Personal Information that Medifi collects may include, but is not limited to, Your first and last name, phone number, email address, home and business postal addresses, including street name and number, city or town and state, and any other information that permits the physical or electronic contacting of an individual.
Personal Information will be collected when You fill in forms from or provide information to us, or use the Services, including the exchange of Your health information with Your Health Care Provider(s). For example, You will provide information to Medifi when downloading the Application, registering with Medifi, subscribing or otherwise using the Software and communicating with Medifi.  Medifi may also ask You for information in conjunction with the Services. Additionally, Medifi will collect information from You when You report a problem with the Services.
Note that Your Health Care Provider’s privacy policy and practices govern how confidential health care information about You may be used and disclosed by Your Health Care Provider. 
You may make use of the Services to transmit or otherwise provide Your confidential health care information, some of which may qualify as "Protected Health Information," as defined under United States federal regulation (see 45 CFR 160.103), to Your Health Care Provider(s).  Any Protected Health Information contributed, transmitted or otherwise provided by You will be governed by a Business Associate Agreement entered into by Medifi with Your Health Care Provider (defined below). Medifi will not use or disclose Your Personal Health Information without Your authorization except as provided by this Privacy Policy or the Business Associate Agreement.
